We all have this friend who never mutes himself, even when he really should...

I've got for you the best gift for this friend - A huge 10cm glowing red button so he can finally mute himself!

This button works but is definitely not a practical solution, more of a funny gift.
The button registers at the computer as keyboard pressing F13 and you can set this to a keybind in Discord, Zoom, or any other software or game.

Wires:
You need 3 pieces of 10 cm wire, basically any gauge will do.
You can salvage wires from an old cable or buy them from this link:

You also need a soldering iron and a hot glue gun for assembly.

Printing:
Support may be needed for the USB port on the upper part.

Assembly:
1) Solder wires between the Arduino to the button electronics section (they separate).
2) Glue to Arduino in its place using hot glue.
3) Glue the button in place using hot glue.
4) Connect the button electronics to the button itself (no glue required).

Wiring:
1) LED minus & button COM to the GND on the Arduino
2) LED plus to an Arduino PWM pin (3 or 6 tested)
3) Button NO to the Arduino digital or analog pin.
